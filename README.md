# Differences in AI perception between South Korea and Vietnam

## Overview

This is a project on the differences in perception of AI between South Korea and Vietnam, based on a survey conducted on over 400 college students and industry professionals who are working in game development and various related fields. The project is being done in collaboration with [GCT Lab](https://gctlab-hongik.ac.kr/), a lab affiliated with the [School of Games](https://www.husg.net/) at [Hongik University](https://www.hongik.ac.kr) in South Korea.
